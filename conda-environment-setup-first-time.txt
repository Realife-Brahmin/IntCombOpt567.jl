# First let's ensure that we're in the correct folder of this repo
cd "/path/to/your/repository"  # Replace with wherever this repo is (the folder containing this readme file)

# We want to create a conda environment IN the very folder of the repo* with a relevant name, say intcombopt567:
conda env create --file env.yml --prefix ./intcombopt567
 # This will create the environment based on all the details in the env.yml file, inside a folder named intcombopt567 in the current directory (note that gitignore is already set to ignore this folder) 

# Let us activate our newly installed conda environment, so that we can later install the relevant packages
conda activate ./intcombopt567

# Let us confirm if our newly created environment has indeed been activated:
conda info # If it points to the intcombopt567 folder that just got created as a result of the conda environment creation, then all is well.
    # If you're getting some message like do conda init then conda activate then do the same, i.e.:
    conda init
    # kill the terminal and restart it and ensure you're in the correct folder again
    conda activate ./intcombopt567
        # If this still shows up the same error, one possible remedy is:
        conda init bash # If you see a 'modified' bash, then possibly the problem is fixed.

# Now try running main.py to see if the environment is set up correctly, you could either just 'Run' the whole file, or try doing a sequence of Shift+Enter commands for each cell.


# FAQs:

## Do I need to have Anaconda installed?

No, you don't need to have Anaconda installed. You can just install Miniconda, which is a minimal installer for conda. It is a much smaller installer compared to Anaconda, and it installs only conda, Python, and other essential packages. You can then install the required packages using conda.

## How do I install Miniconda?

You can download the Miniconda installer from the following link (for Windows): https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
  
  Specific Instructions:
    1. Download the Miniconda installer from the link provided above.
    2. Run the installer.
    3. Install for 'Just Me'. (and not 'All Users')
    4. Select 'Add Miniconda to my PATH environment variable'. (Ignore the warning that it's not recommended)
    5. All other options can be left as default.
    6. Click 'Install'.
    7. Once the installation is complete, you can close the installer.
    8. To check if Miniconda has been installed correctly, open a command prompt and run the command `conda --version`. If Miniconda has been installed correctly, you should see the version of conda that has been installed.
    Sometimes you may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

## Do I need to have Python installed?

No, you don't need to have Python installed. Miniconda will install Python for you.

## I already have a different version of Python installed. Will installing Miniconda cause any issues?

No, installing Miniconda will not cause any issues with your existing Python installation. Miniconda will install Python in a separate environment, and you can choose to use this environment when working on your project.

## Ipopt is not available in SolverFactory. What should I do?

The conda installation may not necessarily generate ipopt.exe, which may be important for the SolverFactory to work. In such cases, you may need to install Ipopt separately from the website: https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Ipopt/Ipopt-3.5.4-win64-icl9.0.zip. Once you have downloaded and installed Ipopt (anywhere on your machine, including, if wanted, inside the intcombopt567 folder inside this repo), you can add the location to the PATH.
